# Deployment Documentation with GitHub Actions

## Introduction

This guide explains how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy an application to a remote server (e.g., AWS EC2). It also details the required environment variables for automation to work correctly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Deployment is only triggered when a branch is merged into main, not when a commit is pushed directly to the branch.

## Setting Up Environment Variables in GitHub Actions

To successfully deploy, certain environment variables need to be configured as secrets in the GitHub repository.

### Required Variables

| Variable              | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AWS_HOST`            | IP address or domain of the EC2 instance. Example: `ec2-18-231-104-85.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com` |
| `AWS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH private key to access the EC2 instance. Must match the public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.     |
| `AWS_USER`            | User with deployment permissions. Usually `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux or `ubuntu` for Ubuntu.          |
| `AWS_WORK_DIRECTORY`  | Path where the app is hosted on EC2. Example: `/home/ec2-user/app`.                                    |

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

This workflow performs the following steps:

- Connects to the server using SSH.

- Navigates to the work directory defined in AWS_WORK_DIRECTORY.

- Clones the repository if it's the first time.

- Runs git pull to update the code.

- Installs dependencies with npm install.

- Restarts the application with pm2.

For the full configuration go to [link](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

## How to Add Environment Variables in GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. In the Settings tab, select Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions.
3. Add each variable in Repository secrets with its respective values.

## Summary

- AWS_HOST ‚Üí EC2 instance IP or domain.
- AWS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY ‚Üí SSH private key for access.
- AWS_USER ‚Üí User to connect to the instance.
- AWS_WORK_DIRECTORY ‚Üí Path where the application is hosted on EC2.

With this configuration, GitHub Actions can automate the deployment of your application on AWS EC2 securely and efficiently. üöÄ
