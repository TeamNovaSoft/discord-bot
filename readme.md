# Discord Bot

This project is a Discord bot built with `discord.js`. The bot includes various functionalities such as polls, automated responses, and more. Below are the instructions on how to run the bot and create new commands.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 23.6.0 or higher)
- Yarn (optional, but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TeamNovaSoft/discord-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd discord-bot
   ```

3. Use the correct version of Node.js:

   ```bash
   nvm use # install if needed
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a new file called `.env` based on the `.env.example` file in the root of the project with the following keys, filled it with the information of your bot:

   ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
     DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
     DISCORD_GUILD_ID = YOUR_GUILD_ID
   ```

   - **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Your Discord bot's token.
   - **DISCORD_CLIENT_ID**: Your bot's client or application ID.
   - **DISCORD_GUILD_ID**: The ID of the server (guild) where the commands will be deployed.

To obtain each of these environment variables, you need to have `Developer Mode` enabled in Discord (if it is not already).

Open Discord to enable developer mode and click on the gear icon (User Settings) at the bottom left.

For detailed instructions on how to create new commands, see [Creating New Commands](docs/creating-commands.md).

## Additional Permissions Configuration

To correctly install the bot on Discord and ensure it can receive and process messages, certain permissions must be configured both in the Discord Developer Portal and in the bot's code. Here are the steps and necessary permissions:

### Additional Permissions Configuration

1. Access the Discord Developer Portal:
   Go to the Discord Developer Portal and select your bot application.
2. Configure the Bot's Scopes and Permissions:

   - In the `Bot` section and check `Message Content Intent` permission to allow app bot the access to content message.

   ![message content intent option](docs/configuration/bot_permissions/message_content_intent_option.png)

   - Navigate to the `Installation` section and then add the select the key permissions.
     ![installation permissions](docs/configuration/bot_permissions/installation_permissions.png)
   - Copy install Link to add your bot in the guild/server.

   ![install link](docs/configuration/bot_permissions/install_link.png)
   Configuring these permissions and intents ensures that your bot can operate effectively, receiving and processing messages as needed.

## Additional Environment Variables

To schedule automated messages, you can configure the following additional environment variables in your `.env` file:

- **ADMIN_POINT_REQUEST_CHANNEL**: environment variable specifies the ID of the Discord channel where point review requests are sent. This is particularly useful for managing and tracking user actions that require admin review.

When the bot needs to notify or alert the administrators by mentioning them directly. For example, when a user requests a point review, the bot can mention the administrators to ensure they see and act on the request promptly. To achieve this functionality, you have to configure it in the `env` file:

- **ADMINISTRATOR_TAG_ID**: environment variable specifies the ID or tag that the bot uses to mention administrators in Discord. This is useful in various scenarios where administrative intervention is required, such as when users need help, when certain actions need approval, or when there are issues that require immediate attention.

When someone mentions the QA role, the bot automatically sends a message to the QA request channel, alerting the QA team. In order to permit this, configuration in the `env` file is required:

- **DISCORD_QA_ROLE_ID**: The ID of the role used to mention the QA team in Discord. When this role is mentioned, the bot sends a message to the specified QA request channel.

- **DISCORD_QA_CHANNEL_ID**: The ID or name of the Discord channel where QA requests are sent. This channel receives notifications whenever the QA role is mentioned.

By setting up these environment variables correctly, you can ensure that your bot properly categorizes and tracks the completion and point assignment for tasks within your Discord server.

- **TASK_COMPLETED_TAG_ID**: environment variable specifies the ID of the tag used for threads related to completed tasks. This helps in categorizing and managing threads where tasks are marked as finished.

- **ADD_POINT_TAG_ID**: environment variable specifies the ID of the tag used to assign points to a completed task or to count the points assigned. This is essential for tracking the points awarded for the completion of tasks.

- **ADD_BOOSTED_POINT_TAG_ID**: environment variable specifies the ID of the tag used to assign boosted points to a completed task or to count the boosted points assigned. This is useful for tasks that are considered with extra points.

- **GEMINI_AI_API_KEY**: Your gemini api key to be use for prompt the AI through the bot commands. You can get it from here: <https://aistudio.google.com>

## Gemini AI

To integrate Discord Bot with the Gemini AI you should get your API Key from <https://aistudio.google.com/> and add it to **GEMINI_AI_API_KEY** on the .env.

## Google Calendar Integration

To integrate the bot with Google Calendar, you need to obtain service account keys from Google Cloud. Follow these steps to set it up correctly:

### Create and Configure the Project in Google Cloud

1. **Access Google Cloud Console**:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

2. **Create a New Project**:

   - Click on the project dropdown at the top and select "New Project."
   - Assign a name to your project and click "Create."

3. **Enable the Google Calendar API**:

   - Within your project, go to **API & Services** > **Library**.
   - Search for "Google Calendar API" and click "Enable."

4. **Create a Service Account**:

   - Go to **API & Services** > **Credentials**.
   - Click "Create Credentials" and select "Service Account."
   - Provide a name for the service account and complete the setup.

5. **Generate a Key for the Service Account**:

   - After creating the service account, select "Create Key."
   - Choose the JSON format and download the key file.

6. **Grant Permissions to the Service Account**:
   - Open Google Calendar with the account you want to integrate.
   - Share the calendar with the service account email address (something like `your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
   - Assign the "Make changes to events" permission.

### Configure the Key File

1. Save the downloaded file (`google-keys.json`) in the root of your project. **Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file** to avoid exposing it in your repository.

### Environment Variables Configuration

To ensure the integration works seamlessly, you need to set up the following environment variables in your .env file:

1. GOOGLE_EMAIL:

   - Description: The Google account email associated with the calendar.
   - Example:

     ```
     GOOGLE_EMAIL=your-google-account@example.com
     ```

2. CHANNEL_CALENDAR_ID:

   - Description: The ID of the Discord channel where calendar notifications will be sent.
   - Example:

     ```
     CHANNEL_CALENDAR_ID=1306251153855610922
     ```

3. SCHEDULED_CALENDAR_ENABLED:

   - Description: A boolean flag to enable or disable the scheduled calendar functionality.
   - Example:

     ```
     SCHEDULED_CALENDAR_ENABLED=false
     ```

## Markdown-Based Scheduled Messages Configuration

Instead of using a CSV string, you can define scheduled messages with Markdown files in the following format:

```
---
days: 1-5
channel: 1306251153855610922
hour: 08
minutes: 00
timezone: America/Bogota
---

Good morning!
```

### Explanation of Markdown Fields

days: Defines the days of the week when the message will be sent. Use a range (e.g., 1-5 for Monday to Friday) or specific days separated by commas (e.g., 1,3,5 for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). Days are numbered from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).

channel: The Discord channel ID where the message will be sent.

hour: The hour (in 24-hour format) when the message will be sent.

minutes: The minute of the hour when the message will be sent.

timezone: Specifies the time zone for scheduling the message. Use a valid time zone string (e.g., America/Bogota).

The content after the metadata block (the --- lines) is the body of the message to be sent.

Example Markdown Scheduled Message

```
---
days: 1-5
channel: 1306251153855610922
hour: 08
minutes: 00
timezone: America/Bogota
---

Good morning!
```

This example schedules a message saying "Good morning!" to be sent to the specified channel every weekday (Monday to Friday) at 8:00 AM in the America/Bogota time zone.
